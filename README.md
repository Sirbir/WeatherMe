# WeatherMe
Weather Me is an Android app that tells user what to wear based on the current weather.  When the user starts the app, they will
encounter a "Location" page where they can enter any location via typing or Google voice recognition.  Once the user enters a location via the two previously mentioned options, they can press the "Weather Me" button that will take them to the "Wear" page.  On this page, the user will be given clothing suggestions based on current weather conditions accompanied with a supplemental clothing picture.  From the "Wear" page users can access the "Weather" page that will display current weather conditions.  Both the Wear and Weather page display an animated background in the form of a gif based on the current weather conditions. The gender of the people wearing clothes on the wear page, the clothing suggested based on gender, and the unit of the temperatures displayed on the weather page can be changed on the "Settings" page.  Finally the "About" page displays the purpose of the app.
